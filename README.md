### Inspiration:

-  When it comes to exploring their culinary talents in the comfort of their own kitchens, many aspiring and seasoned home cooks confront hurdles.
-  They struggle to find fresh and creative recipes they often seeking changes or adaptations of traditional dishes to suit their preferences.
-  In the absence of a helpful and inspirational culinary community, the culinary journey may be lonely and uninteresting, leaving home cooks yearning for opportunities to interact, exchange experiences, and be inspired by their colleagues.

### What it does:
- This project is created with the intention to cater to individuals to bring out their culinary skills and experiment with try and tested recipes out there



### Challanges we ran into:

- Finding a proper **API** to fetch the desired results was indeed a challange we ran into
- While building this project we got certain bugs like how to fetch the recipes and their corresponding informations from the APIs
- Had trouble working with **mealDB API** for the first time

### What's Next For Our Project:

- We intend to build a sharing platform for the community of chefs and foodies out there.
- In order to do so, we would love to add further features to our website, like a feature to post new recipes and share it with the community
- People would be able to upload the recipes and share with their community, tag foods and recipes they have recently tried and share it with the world
